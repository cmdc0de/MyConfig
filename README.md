# MyConfig

These are my perferences set up in such a way that on a new computer I close this repo then run install.sh and I'm done.  
Added new script that installs libraries and tools to reverse engineer and PDF transformations.

# Current configuration
* Installs Kitty
* Sets up Vim to my liking
* Given a install dir the setup_python_tools.sh script will install libraries and frameworks I've used and enjoy using to do RE tasks and PDF investigtations.


# what it does not do
* while there is a directory for neovim I am not currnetly using neovim
* you need to run getnf yourself, and install vim yourself


# Installation process
sudo apt install vim llvm cmake
clone this repo
run getnf
run install.sh
